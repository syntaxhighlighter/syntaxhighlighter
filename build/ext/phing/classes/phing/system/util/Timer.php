 * This class can be used to obtain the execution time of all of the scripts

 * Example:
 * To be done before any scripts execute:
 *
 * $Timer = new Timer;
 * $Timer->Start_Timer();
 *
 * To be done after all scripts have executed:
 *
 * $timer->Stop_Timer();
 * $timer->Get_Elapsed_Time(int number_of_places);
