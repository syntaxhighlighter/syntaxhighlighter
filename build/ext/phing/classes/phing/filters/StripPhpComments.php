/**
 * This is a Php comment and string stripper reader that filters
 * those lexical tokens out for purposes of simple Php parsing.
 * (if you have more complex Php parsing needs, use a real lexer).
 * Since this class heavily relies on the single char read function,
 * you are reccomended to make it work on top of a buffered reader.
