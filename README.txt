SyntaxHighlighter is a fully functional self-contained code syntax highlighter
developed in JavaScript.

For normal deployment, visit http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter
and follow the instructions there.

For deployment from sources, you first have to build SyntaxHighlighter.
You can _not_ run it from the source repository directly.

To build, follow the instructions in build/README.txt.

You will need at least: PHP5 (command line), PHP PEAR package and Java
to build.
