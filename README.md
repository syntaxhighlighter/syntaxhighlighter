## NOTE: Version 4 is being developed [here](https://github.com/syntaxhighlighter)

SyntaxHighlighter is THE client side highlighter for the web and apps! It's been around since
2004 and it's used virtually everywhere to seamlessly highlight code for presentation.

# Development

Please note the `master` branch is in active development and **is currently not stable**. I'm working hard to bring up the entire project up to date (all the way from 2004). Alot has changed since then in the JavaScript world.

If you are looking for a stable release, please see [v3.0.9](https://github.com/syntaxhighlighter/syntaxhighlighter/releases/tag/v3.0.9).

**I'm looking for a sponsor to help me spend more time on this project.**

## Roadmap

### Version 4

Version 4 will bring up the whole project up to date. It will be fully compatible with exiting 3.x brushes and themes.

- [x] Split up themes into modules
- [x] Split up brushes into modules
- [x] Remove autoloader
- [ ] Update build

* `XRegExp` now lives in `SyntaxHighlighter.XRegExp`

### Version 5

Version 5 will be a whole new beast with new features and will most likely be incompatible with v4 and v3 brushes.
