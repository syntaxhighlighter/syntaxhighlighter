SyntaxHighlighter is THE client side highlighter for the web and web-apps! It's been around since 2004 and it's used virtually everywhere to seamlessly highlight code for presentation purposes.

The history of this project predates majority of the common web technologies and it has been a challenge to dedicate time and effort to keep it up to date. Everything used to be in one file and assign `window` variables... Horrors!

SyntaxHighlighter is currently used and has been used in the past by Microsoft, Apache, Mozilla, Yahoo, Wordpress, Bug Labs, Freshbooks and many other companies and blogs.

# Support

As it always goes with open source, you are welcome to use SyntaxHighlighter free of charge. If you are using and enjoying my work, maybe you could buy me a beer (or if you don’t drink – a coffee and bagel will do just fine, a good kind of bagel though, you know… with wonderful stuff inside to make it glorious, like smoked salmon and creamcheese… not just butter).

**Please [click here to donate via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=2930402) and just like they say on TV – give generously! It motivates me to keep working on this (12 years now and counting).**
